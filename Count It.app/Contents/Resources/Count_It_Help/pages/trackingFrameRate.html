	<div id="header">Tracking the Frame Rate</div>
	<br/><br/>
	In order to track the frame rate, the game must first be added to Count It.  Go to <a href="addingGame.html">Adding a Game</a> to learn how to add a game.
	<br/><br/>
	Select a game and then use the toolbar buttons to start tracking the frame rate.  By default, the frame rate is displayed in the lower left corner of your screen.
	The location and other options can be modified using the <a href="preferences.html">preference menu</a>.
	<br/><br/>Only one game can be tracked at a time.
	<br/><br/><br/>
	<div>
		<div class="category">Launch:</div>
		<div>
			If the game is not yet running, clicking "Launch" will first launch the game.  Once the game is launched, Count It will start tracking the frame rate.
			<br/><br/>
			<div class="note">Note: If you use a third-party platform (i.e. Steam) to play the game, Count It should not be used to launch the game.  See "Wait" below.</div>
		</div>
		<br/><br/>
		<div>
			<div class="category">Start:</div>
			<div>If the game is already running, click "Start" to begin tracking the frame rate.</div>
		</div>
		<br/><br/>
		<div class="category">Stop:</div>
		<div>
			Stop tracking the frame rate at any time by clicking "Stop"
		</div>
		<br/><br/>
		<div class="category">Wait:</div>
		<div>Choosing "Wait" tells Count It to wait for the selected game to launch.  Once the game launches, Count It will begin tracking the frame rate.
			<br/><br/>This is most useful in two situations:
			<ol>
				<li>If you use a third-party platform to play your games, you will not be able to take advantage the platform's' features if you launch the game from Count It.
					Instead, select the game, choose "Wait", and then launch the game using the launch feature of the platform.
				</li>
				<li>
					Many games do not allow you to switch between apps when playing in fullscreen mode.  Using the "Wait" option allows you to launch a game directly into
					fullscreen mode without having to switch back to Count It to start tracking the frame rate.
				</li>
			</ol>
