			<div>
                By default, a button is placed in the frame rate display that can be used to start and stop a recording session
                while tracking a game's frame rate.
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li>Primary Color:
					<br/>Sets the color of the button.  This will also be used as the background color of the FPS display
                    when "Use for FPS display while recording" is enabled.
					<br/><br/>
				</li>
				<li>Secondary Color:
					<br/>Sets the border color of the button.  This will also be used as the FPS text color when
                    "Use for FPS display while recording" is enabled.
					<br/><br/>
				</li>
                <li>Use for FPS display while recording:
                    <br/>When enabled, these same colors are used to alter the color of the FPS display.  Changing the color of
                    the FPS display while recording can be useful to make it more obvious that a recording is in process, especially
                    if "Display Recording Button in FPS Display" is disabled.
