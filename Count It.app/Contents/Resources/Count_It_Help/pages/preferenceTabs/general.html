			<ul>
				<li>Auto Start:
					<br/>When selected, Count It will automatically search for and begin tracking the frame rate of any game that has previously been added to Count It once it is launched.
							With auto start on, there is no need to manually click "Launch" or "Start" from the main toolbar.
					<br/><br/>
				</li>
				<li>Auto Stop:
					<br/>When selected, Count It will automatically stop tracking the frame rate once the game is closed.  When deselected, when a game that is
					being tracked closes, Count It will automatically start waiting for the game to relaunch.  This can be useful in situations in which a game's
					launcher or other such process (i.e. graphics settings changes) force the game to relaunch.  In this situation, if auto stop is off, Count It
					would automatically reconnect to the game.
				</li>

			<div class="category">Decimal Precision:</div>
			<div>Formats the frame rate to display the specified number of digits to the right of the decimal.</div>
		</div>
		<br/><br/>
		<div class="category">Sampling Rate:</div>
		<div>
			Adjusts the frequency that the frame rate is updated.  A higher sampling rate means that the frame rate is updated more often.
		</div>
        <br/><br/>
        <div class="category">Save Directory:</div>
        <div>
            The directory that all app data and automatic recording session exports will be saved to.  Changing this directory will move
            the existing files to the new location.
