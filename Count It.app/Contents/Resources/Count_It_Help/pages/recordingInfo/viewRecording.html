            All recordings (see <a href="preferenceTabs/recording.html">Recording Preferences</a> for information on how to perform a recording) are automatically saved for viewing from within Count It.  To view a recording, select a game and then choose "View" > "Show Graph" from the main menu.  Alternatively, click the button titled "Graph" from the tool bar.  Then select the recording from the "Recording Sessions" list.

        The data from a recording is graphed as frames per second over time in minutes and seconds.  The y-axis marks the maximum, minimum, and average sample frame rates for the recording.  Mousing over a data point will display the frame rate for that data point.  The maximum and minimum data points are drawn in red.  The average frame rate is marked as a green horizontal line.  Depending on the number of data points in a particular recording, some data points may be hidden in order to properly display the data points.  When this occurs, you can adjust the zoom level of the graph to get a more detailed view.  To do so, select "View" > "Zoom" and then the desired type of display from the main menu.  Alternatively, use the "Zoom" toolbar button.  The "Zoom" toolbar button provides an additinal level of zoom functionality through the use of a slider.  The graph can be zoomed up to 500%.
